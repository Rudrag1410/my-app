# BlinkMoney — AI Wealth Agent

A chat-first AI agent, backed by real OpenAI tool calling, that helps a user set a Save/Grow
goal and start a SIP — and, when the user signals a cash need, steers them toward borrowing
against their portfolio instead of breaking their SIP.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

2. Add your OpenAI API key to `.env` (already gitignored):

   ```
   EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
   ```

3. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

## Known trade-off

`EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY` ships inside the client bundle, so it's visible to anyone who
inspects the app. This is acceptable for this assignment's scope, but in production this call
should move behind a backend proxy that holds the key server-side and forwards chat/tool-call
requests on the client's behalf.

One consequence of this: OpenAI's Chat Completions API does not send CORS headers, so it can't
be called directly from a browser — the web target (`expo start --web`) will hit a CORS error
on every turn. Native (iOS/Android) is unaffected, since CORS is a browser-only restriction.

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started (Expo boilerplate)

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
